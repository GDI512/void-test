\section{About}

The \voidtest\ testing framework is a simple general-purpose set of utilities designed for finding
bugs in \cpp\ programs. It features most assertions present in other testing frameworks as well as
random number generators and a helper type used for ensuring proper resource management by
container classes. \par
The main difference between \voidtest\ and other frameworks is that it does not include any standard
or system headers within its own header files and avoids macros \italic{by design}. In practice,
what that means is that it is \italic{extremely} fast to compile and more intuitive to use at the
expense of lacking any thread-safety whatsoever.
