\section{About}
\voidtest\ is a lightweight and completely macro-free \cplusplus\ testing framework
which makes heavy use of lambdas and other modern \cplusplus\ features. Because it
does not include any system or standard headers within its own header files, it
has almost no impact on compile times compared to other libraries.
