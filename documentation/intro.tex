\section{Getting Started}
Integrating \voidtest\ into a CMake project is easy. Simply clone the Git
repository somewhere into your source tree and add it via the
\verb!add_subdirectory()! command. Because \voidtest\ defines an alias target
\verb!void_test::void_test! you will be able to link with it using
\verb!target_link_libraries()!. It is highly recommended to run the test suite
before using it though, as some parts of this framework rely on
implementation-defined behavior. The whole procedure should look as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Clone \verb!https://github.com/GDI512/void-test.git! anywhere you want
  \item Run \verb!cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo! in that
  directory to generate build files
  \item Run \verb!cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo! to build \voidtest\
  \item Run \verb!cd build && ctest -C RelWithDebInfo! to see if everything works
  as expected --- in case some of the tests fail, please report an issue on Github
  \item If everything went right, repeat the first step except this time clone the
  repository as a subdirectory of your project
  \item Link \voidtest\ to your test executables as explained at the beginning of
  this section
\end{enumerate}
In case you cannot use CMake as your project's build system, stop at the 4th
step, find the compiled static library in the build directory and copy
it with the header files.
